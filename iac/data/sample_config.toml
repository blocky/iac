# IAC needs AWS credentials to create and tear down infrastructure
# there are various ways that these credentials can be supplied.
# Either provide an absolute path to a credentials file (the CSV file that AWS
# provides when you create an access token) or provide values for access key and
# secret key (the values in the creds file)
#
# You MUST change or specify via env var or command line arg
cred_file = "string.csv"
# access_key = "string"
# secret_key = "string"

# When managing keys, pem files are created and stored locally for interacting
# with the EC2 instance. The value should be a absolute path for storing
# those keys.
# **WARNING**: Choose with care. The pem files stored in this directory are
# considered sensitive.
#
# You MUST change or specify via env var or command line arg
secrets_folder = "string"

# Name of the EC2 instance to be managed by IAC - globally unique
#
# You MUST change or specify via env var or command line arg

# Name of the EC2 key to use for connections to EC2 instances
#
# You MUST change or specify via env var or command line arg
key_name = "string"

# Name of the AWS region for new EC2 instances.
#
# We suggest using the region `us-east-1`.
# Other regions may work, however, this project uses a
# specific instance type that is not available in all regions.
#
# You MUST change or specify via env var or command line arg
region = "string"

# Name of the AWS security group for new EC2 instances
#
# It is assumed that the security group is already created and
# configured properly. The value "mwittie-testing" works but card
# [BKY-2779](https://blocky.atlassian.net/browse/BKY-2779)
# will add functionality to set up security groups with code.
#
# You MUST change or specify via env var or command line arg
